<pingou>\twell that's good :)\nJul 25 19:07:53 <pingou>\tso you know the work it is to create some web pages\nJul 25 19:08:10 <pingou>\tand the work it requires to have all these pages look similar\nJul 25 19:08:28 <pingou>\tyou know with the same header at the top, the same column/menu on the right/left\nJul 25 19:08:31 *\telita15_ (75d3566d@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.211.86.109) has joined #dgplug\nJul 25 19:08:52 <pingou>\twell web framework such as flask allow you to create the web page dynamically\nJul 25 19:09:12 <pingou>\tdo you see what I mean when I'm speaking about framework?\nJul 25 19:09:36 <J_Caselles>\tyes\nJul 25 19:09:40 <pingou>\t(btw, feel free to ask any question, any time)\nJul 25 19:09:50 *\tcha1tanya has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)\nJul 25 19:10:22 <pingou>\tsince only J_Caselles seems to know what frameworks are, I'll just explain it in a sentence\nJul 25 19:10:44 <pingou>\tthey are a group of libraries that you can use to create an application, the idea is that they make your life easier\nJul 25 19:11:18 <pingou>\tflask, pyramid, turbogears, django are example of web framework\nJul 25 19:11:33 <manishjain2792>\ta certain type of package that will help to create application, am i right ? pingou.\nJul 25 19:11:34 <pingou>\tflask is part of the family of the so-called, micro-framework\nJul 25 19:11:58 <pingou>\tmanishjain2792: not a type really, more a set of packages, but yes, the idea is that they help you\nJul 25 19:12:43 <pingou>\tmicro-frameworks are basically frameworks with little to no dependencies\nJul 25 19:13:05 <pingou>\tin the case of flask, there are only 2: Werkzeug and Jinja\nJul 25 19:13:25 *\travi_pro (7b3f0d75@gateway/web/freenode/ip.123.63.13.117) has joined #dgplug\nJul 25 19:13:28 <pingou>\twe will see jinja a little bit, but not really Werkzeug (although we will use it, within flask\nJul 25 19:13:31 <pingou>\t)\nJul 25 19:13:43 <J_Caselles>\t!\nJul 25 19:13:44 <pingou>\tlet's start with jinja\nJul 25 19:13:47 <pingou>\t> J_Caselles\nJul 25 19:14:01 <J_Caselles>\twhat other types of web app framework exists?\nJul 25 19:14:28 <pingou>\tJ_Caselles: good question, the other framework are not really named\nJul 25 19:14:57 <pingou>\tbasically a framework like TurboGears comes with a lot of dependencies, all well-designed and aiming at helping you\nJul 25 19:15:18 <pingou>\thowever it means that you need to keep up with all of them and updating might become challenging :)\nJul 25 19:15:35 <J_Caselles>\tnice, thanks <eof>\nJul 25 19:15:37 <pingou>\twith only 2 dependencies, flask is much easier to update and follow :)\nJul 25 19:15:51 <J_Caselles>\t:)\nJul 25 19:16:10 <pingou>\tJ_Caselles: for example, TurboGears imposes how you are connecting to a database\nJul 25 19:16:23 <pingou>\t(same thing for Django)\nJul 25 19:16:45 <pingou>\tflask does not do anything with databases, it will be up to you to set up your application the way you want it\nJul 25 19:17:08 <pingou>\tso sometime micro-framework might give you a little more work when developing\nJul 25 19:17:11 <J_Caselles>\tso, it doesn't help you with everything, wich sometimes might be prefered\nJul 25 19:17:58 <pingou>\tJ_Caselles: indeed, it basically comes back to a balance between \"all in one\" vs \"freedom to implement the way I want\"\nJul 25 19:18:08 <J_Caselles>\tnice\nJul 25 19:18:17 <pingou>\tI like the second one :)\nJul 25 19:18:22 *\tsamikshan has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)\nJul 25 19:18:23 <pingou>\t(thus this presentation :))\nJul 25 19:18:32 <J_Caselles>\thehe\nJul 25 19:18:32 <pingou>\tso let's come back to jinja\nJul 25 19:18:38 <pingou>\tjinja is a template engine\nJul 25 19:18:45 <pingou>\thave you guys ever used templates?\nJul 25 19:18:51 <shantanu>\tyes\nJul 25 19:19:01 <pingou>\tin which context?\nJul 25 19:19:02 *\toini has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)\nJul 25 19:19:04 <rahulch>\tyes\nJul 25 19:19:06 <J_Caselles>\tno\nJul 25 19:19:19

let me quickly introduce what templates are\nJul 25 19:20:35 <pingou>\tthey are basically pages where you set some element as fix and leave some empty, to be filled later on\nJul 25 19:20:36 <pingou>\ta bit like a form you fill for an administration\nJul 25 19:20:49 <pingou>\tyou have questions and cases for the answer\nJul 25 19:21:03 <pingou>\twell in web development you will use template pretty much in the same way\nJul 25 19:21:56 <pingou>\texcept that instead of having \"Date of birth: __/__/____\" you will have \"<title>{{title}}</title>\"\nJul 25 19:22:21 <pingou>\twhere {{title}} is replaced by what you want\nJul 25 19:22:41 <pingou>\tin web application you use the template to set the style of your pages\nJul 25 19:23:09 <pingou>\tyou have one main template, which defines the header at the top, the footer at the bottom, the column on the right/left with the menu\nJul 25 19:23:24 <pingou>\tand somewhere in the middle you will put the content, content that changes from page to page\nJul 25 19:23:39 <pingou>\tdo you follow me?\nJul 25 19:23:43 <anuragk>\tyes.\nJul 25 19:23:44 <rahulch>\tyes\nJul 25 19:23:44 <m0rin09m`>\tyes\nJul 25 19:23:48

16:25:57 <ncoghlan>\thowever, the only rule we enforce in the standard library is that, wherever practical, any change must be accompanied by a test for that change\nJul 17 16:26:07 <zishan>\tkya
